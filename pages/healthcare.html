			Artificial Intelligence has been playing a robust and growing role
			in the world the past few decades.

			<strong>
				One major area AI is growing rapidly is the medical field;
				specifically, in diagnostics and treatment management. As there
				is a fear of Artificial Intelligence surpassing human tasks and
				ability, there is significant research as to how AI can aid in
				clinical decisions, support human judgement and increase
				treatment efficiency.
			</strong>
			<br /><br />

			There are various magnitudes of AI in healthcare. Many times, AI
			utilizes a web database allowing doctors and practitioners to access
			thousands of diagnostic resources. As doctors have been deeply
			educated in their field and are current with present research, the
			use of AI greatly increases a faster outcome that can be matched
			with their clinical knowledge. Artificial Intelligence presents many
			fears, especially in the clinical setting, of eventually replacing
			or reducing the need for human physicians. However, recent research
			and data has shown that it is more likely this tool will benefit and
			enhance clinical diagnostics and decision making rather than reduce
			clinician need. <br /><br />

			Many times, a patient can present multiple symptoms that can
			correlate with various conditions by both genetic and physical
			characteristics, which can delay a diagnosis. So, not only does AI
			benefit a practitioner in terms of efficiency, it provides both
			quantitative and qualitative data based on input feedback, improving
			accuracy in early detection, diagnosis, treatment plan and an
			outcome prediction. <br /><br />

			The ability for AI to “learn” from the data provides the opportunity
			for improved accuracy based on feedback responses. This feedback
			includes many back-end database sources, input from practitioners,
			doctors, and research institutions. The AI systems in healthcare are
			always working in real time, which means the data is always
			updating, thus increasing accuracy and relevance. Assembled data is
			a compilation of different medical notes, electronic recordings from
			medical devices, laboratory images, physical examinations and
			various demographics. With this compilation of endlessly updating
			information, practitioners have almost unlimited resources to
			improve their treatment capabilities.
